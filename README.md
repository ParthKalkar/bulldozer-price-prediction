In this notebook, we're going to go through a machine learning project with the goald of predicting the sale price of bulldozers. This involves a time series data which was taken from Kaggle Bluebook Bulldozers competition.

# Predicting the sales price of bulldozers

In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers

## 1. Problem Statement
> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for

## 2. Data

The data has been downloaded from Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition

## 3. Evaluation
The evaluation metric is the RMSE between the actual and predicted auction prices 

> Note: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error

## 4. Features

Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset.
